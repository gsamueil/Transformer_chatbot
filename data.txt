Q: What is a Transformer?
A: It's a deep learning model that uses attention to simultaneously analyze context.

Q: What are the advantages of Transformers?
A: It supports parallel learning and is good at learning long dependencies.

Q: What are the disadvantages of Transformers?
A: It requires a lot of computation and is inefficient for processing long inputs.

Q: What is GPT?
A: It's a language generation model based on a Transformer decoder.

Q: What is BERT?
A: It's a language understanding model based on a Transformer encoder.

Q: What is attention?
A: It's a mechanism that calculates the correlation between input words using weights.

Q: What is self-attention?
A: It's a method for automatically calculating the relationships between words in a sentence.

Q: What is an encoder?
A: It's the part that extracts features to understand the input sentence.

Q: What is a decoder?
A: It's the part that generates new outputs based on the understood information.

Q: Why is positional encoding necessary?
A: Because the Transformer doesn't know the order, it adds positional information.

Q: What is multi-head attention?
A: It creates a richer representation by performing attention multiple times from different perspectives.

Q: Why is a feedforward network used?
A: It's the step that processes the information obtained through attention in a more complex way.

Q: What is layer normalization?
A: It's a regularization technique that stabilizes learning and accelerates convergence.

Q: Why is dropout necessary?
A: It prevents overfitting and helps the model generalize.

Q: When is masking necessary?
A: It's used when you need to predict the next word without looking at the future words.

Q: How is a Transformer different from an RNN?
A: While RNNs process sequentially, Transformers process in parallel, making them faster and more efficient.

Q: What's the difference between Transformers and CNNs?
A: CNNs are strong at local features, while Transformers look at the entire context simultaneously.

Q: Where are Transformers used?
A: They're used in a variety of fields, including translation, summarization, question-answering, chatbots, and speech processing.

Q: What is ChatGPT?
A: It's a large-scale language generation model based on the GPT series.

Q: What is fine-tuning?
A: It's additionally training an already trained model for a specific task.

Q: What is pre-training?
A: It's the process of first learning general language patterns using large amounts of data.
